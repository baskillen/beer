== Recipe Modification ==

After having received some kind of "made up recipe as we go" from the brew shop, I went home and recalculated the recipe to decrease the IBU a bit. 
This was probably not really a good idea, but .... well ... I wanted to aim for an IBU of 55.
Also, I added Cascade for dry-hopping after 3 weeks of fermentation.

The original recipe looked like this:
Boil 1 (12,5 L, 20 mins):
Schedule:
  20 minutes: 25 g Amarillo hops (9,6%)
              25 g Cascade hops (6%)
   5 minutes: 25 g Amarillo hops (9,6%)
              25 g Cascade hops (6%)

Boil 2 (12,5 L, 60 mins):
Schedule:
  60 minutes: 28 g Chinook hops (11,9%) 
  20 minutes: 25 g Amarillo hops (9,6%)
              25 g Cascade hops (6%)
   5 minutes: 25 g Amarillo hops (9,6%)
              25 g Cascade hops (6%)

== Process ==

=== Brew day 2012-08-07 ===

Boil #1:

Boiling a bit more than half the pot while filling it up with pre boiled water from the water boiler got the boil to start pretty fast.
From cool to boil in around 30 minutes. Everything went quite smooth except that I might have gotten some dirt from the fan into the 
brewing pot while boiling. Not really sure what that might do to the beer.

Cooling the wort in the sink is pretty stupid. The water became really hot in about a minute, so after 30 minutes I gave up and put it 
in the bath tub instead. That went much smoother. Cold in about 30 more minutes.

I poured the wort in the fermenter and shut it with a sanitized lid. Unfortunately I did not have any "saftsil" and as I accidently mixed
up the sediments with the final liter of wort in the pot I had to pour it out. Lost about a liter here. 


Boil #2:
Same procedure as above. Wiped the kitchen fan a bit better this time. A lot of fluid disappeared during the boil. Maybe a bit too much...
Maybe I should have added the water back again?
Cooled the wort in the bath tub this time. Took about 30 minutes.
Poured the wort into the fermenter in a bt more controlled way not to lose too much fluid. Would probably work better with a "saftsil".

Got in total 17 liters of wort.

Measuring the OG was not made in the best way. I sanitized the hydrometer and put it into the fermenter, but I did not know that 
if you spin the hydrometer it will lose the foam around it to easier give a fair result. On top of that I did not read the temperature.
Due to the foam on top I had a really hard time reading, but I estimated the OG to 66.

OG: 66

Pitched the dry yeast on top of the wort in the fermenter. I might have been to eager to get the fermentation started, so I might have
aerated the yeast/wort too early, but it might also have been after 20 minutes of rest. The aeration was done by shaking the 
fermentation bucket wild and crazy with an empty water lock in the lid. After that i filled the water lock with star san and left it on 
the floor in our basement.


=== Bottle cleaning ===

Cleaning bottles by filling up an unused fermentation bucket with bottles, hot water and dishwasher detergent. Had the first batch in 
the bucket over night, and by the time I took care of the bottles the water was cold. Scrubbed all bottles free from glue and dirt 
inside and out. 

Tried to get as much of the water out of the bottles and covered it with a piece of aluminum foil.

Put all bottles in the oven on 170 degrees for >1 hour.

Store the bottles until bottling day. They should remain sterilized.


=== Fermentation ===

Fermentation in the basement at around 22 degrees.
Started bubbling the next day and went on for 5 days until the bubbles decreased significantly. I moved the bucket from the cold floor
to on top of a cardboard box to insulate the cold a bit.

Secondary fermentation kept on for almost 2 weeks. After 2 weeks and 1 day I did measure the OG and also added 25 grams of Cascade hops.

OG: 14


=== Bottling day 2012-09-08 ===

Cleaning all the equipment turned out to be a huge problem. The star-san solution got bad almost instantly all the time. Next time use more star-san in the solution.

Brought all clean bottles and removed the aluminum foil. That was stupid. Got some left over bottles that need to be sterilized one more time.

Priming solution:
  5 g sugar per liter for 16,5 liters of wort = 82,5 g of sugar.
  Added 1 dl of water and boiled until sugar was desolved.
  Cooled the solution

Added the solution to a bottling fermenter
Siphoning the beer to the bottling fermenter. Didn't wait that long before I started filling bottles by siphoning. Should probably have waited for a while to let the yeast and slurry settle before starting? Siphoning sucks! I need to come up with another way of doing that.

Ended up with having only 14,5 liters of beer on bottle. Where did the rest of it go???
